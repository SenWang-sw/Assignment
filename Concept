1. What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
A person’s telephone number -> String
A person’s height -> double
A person’s age -> int
A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer) -> string
A person’s salary -> decimal
A book’s ISBN -> string
A book’s price -> decimal
A book’s shipping weight -> double
A country’s population -> long
The number of stars in the universe -> decimal
The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business) -> int
2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables?
    (1). -> value is stored in stack, ref is stored in heap
    (2). -> original value will not be changed if value variable was processed in function
         -> original value will be changed  if ref variable was processed in function
3. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0? 
    -> it will cause an error: division by constant zero
4. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0? 
    -> it will not cause error, the output is positive infinity
5. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range? 
    -> it will become a negetive number
6. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
    -> the process order is different. 
       -> x=y++, x will be the value of y before y increment by 1
       -> x=++y, x will be the value of y increment by 1
7. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
    -> break will stop the loop immediately
    -> continue will skip the current iteration
    -> return will return a value and stop the loop
8. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
    -> initialization , condition , iteration
    -> condition and iteration are required, for initilization we can initilize the variable before the loop
